This is Cohort A Team 7 from Business Analytics program in Questrom School of Business, Boston University. We are creating this repository for the BA 810 (Supervised Machine Learning) team project. The dataset we are using is the `Avocado Price` dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices).

This project is launched on the assumption that we are going to open an "Everything Avocado" store, primarily selling avocado products including avocado toasts, avocado smoothies, and guacamole & chips. We would like to make a budget on the price and volumn (numbers) of raw avocados. Given the `Avodaco Price` dataset, we would like to build models to predict these factors and apply those predictions to adjust our plan.

This project contains two phases. Phase I is a brief presentation of choice of dataset and the business problem. The team accomplished that on September 30, 2019 and got approval from the instructor.

The link will direct to the Phase I [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g5iKTYi_I7GHrR_ptDDSRX2YzNs0mWYvDxJCneS36Dc/edit#slide=id.p).

Phase II is the final presentation with the submission of our model script, which will due on October 16, 2019.
